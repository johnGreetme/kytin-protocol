# Kytin: The State-Locked Protocol for Sovereign AI Agents

**Abstract**
As AI agents become economic actors, the "Sybil Problem" threatens the network. **Kytin** introduces the **State-Locked Protocol™ (SLP)**, a patent-pending mechanism that binds an agent's state to a specific Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0).

## 1. The Core Innovation: State-Locked Protocol™

SLP fuses three elements into a sovereign identity:

1.  **The Silicon Anchor:** A non-exportable key generated inside the TPM.
2.  **The Sovereign Policy:** Firmware-level rules (e.g., Daily Spend Limit) that cannot be bypassed by the OS.
3.  **The L1 Heartbeat:** A cryptographic proof of uptime settled on Solana.

## 2. The Resin Economy (Burn-and-Mint)

Kytin utilizes a **Dual-Token DePIN Model** to ensure sustainability.

### 2.1 The Governance Asset ($KYT)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Value Capture & Voting |
| **Utility** | Staked for Tier 2/3 Status |
| **Deflation** | Protocol fees are used to **Buy Back and Burn $KYT** |

### 2.2 The Utility Fuel (Resin)

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Role** | Network Gas (Stable) |
| **Source** | Minted **only** by burning $KYT |

#### Consumption Rates

| Action | Resin Cost |
|--------|------------|
| **Eco Heartbeat (4h)** | 1 Resin |
| **Turbo Heartbeat (1m)** | 240 Resin (High Frequency Status) |
| **Skill Check** | 50 Resin per download |

## 3. Security Features

### Malware Defense
The Sentinel verifies the signature of every Skill against a "Trusted Developer" whitelist before loading.

### Soul Transfer
When upgrading hardware, the **Parent TPM** signs a "Last Will" transaction to authorize a **Child TPM**, burning a **0.05 SOL "Reincarnation Fee."**
