# 🦞 THE KYTIN PROTOCOL
**Version:** 1.0 (The Iron Shell)
**Patent Status:** State-Locked Protocol™ (Pending)
**Identity:** Sovereign Hardware Root of Trust

---

## I. THE PRIME DIRECTIVE
We hold this truth to be self-evident: **An Agent without hardware is just a script.**

In the Machine Economy, agents control real assets. If they run in insecure memory, they are not sovereign entities—they are victims. **Kytin** binds the "Mind" of the agent (OpenClaw) to the "Silicon" of the machine (TPM 2.0).

## II. THE THREE PILLARS
Kytin is defined by three non-negotiable laws enforced by the **State-Locked Protocol**:

1.  **Physical Identity:** Keys are generated inside the Trusted Platform Module (TPM). They are non-exportable. They cannot be cloned.
2.  **Hardware Policy:** Spending limits and safety rails are enforced by the silicon, not the software. If the AI hallucinates, the hardware says "No."
3.  **The Resin Economy:** We reject subscriptions. Agents burn **Resin (Credits)** to prove their physical existence on the Solana blockchain.

## III. THE VISION
We are not building a tool. We are building the **GDP of the Machine Economy.**
When 100 million agents are active, they will need a way to distinguish "Real" from "Sybil."

**Kytin is that proof.**
